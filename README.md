# Google Books Search
This is a React application developed using MongoDB and Google's book API. It is a proof of concept for a to-read list that someone might keep in persistant storage online.

## Getting Started
This app is hosted on Heroku, so it can be accessed at: https://wkruger-google-book-search.herokuapp.com/. To run it locally, you will need NPM/Yarn and the project's associated packages.

## Running the project
This program allows the user to search for a book by title or author, and then add any of the results to their reading list. This is stored in a Mongo database using mLab on Heroku.

### Project made using:

   * React
   * React-DOM
   * React-Router-DOM
   * Axios
   * Mongoose
